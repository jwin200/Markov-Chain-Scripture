and total number of occurences for all following words

original_markov = {
    'I':    ([('am',  5), ('will',  7),  ('do', 19)], 31),
    'will': ([('not', 7), ('never', 9)]             , 16)
}

Final object stores key word and list of following words with their chance of occurence

markov_chain = {
    'I':    [('am',  .16), ('will',  .26),  ('do', .61)],
    'will': [('not', .44), ('never', .56)              ]
